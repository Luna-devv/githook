**⚠️ In development, breaking changes ⚠️**

## About
GitHook is a Discord -> GitHub middleware designed to improve GitHub notifications for discord. Basically just a modern and nicer version of the discord built-in GitHub webhook support.

If you need help developing with this, join **[our Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/yYd6YKHQZH)**.

```yml
services:
  app:
    image: ghcr.io/luna-devv/githook:latest
    container_name: githook
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:

REDIS_ADDR="127.0.0.1:6379"
SECRET="replace-me-with-a-random-string"
```

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

## Develope
Clone this repo and start the server with the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Luna-devv/githook

```

## Usage
To create a webhook, you have to follow the following steps:
1. Go to [localhost:8080/create?url=<discord-webhook>](http://localhost:8080/create?url=); replace `<discord-webhook>` with an actual webhook url.
2. Go to your repostitories webhook settings.
3. Enter `http://localhost:8080/incomming/<hash>`; replace `<hash>` with the hash returned from step 1 and 2.
4. Set **Content Type** to `application/json`, **Secret** to none, enable *SSL Verification** and enable all events.
